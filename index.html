        <p class="blog-post-meta   pb-1 mb-4"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">January 1, 2021 by </font><a href="#"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Mark</font></a></p>

            This blog post showcases a few different types of content that are supported and designed with Bootstrap. Basic text, images, and code are fully supported.</p>
            <hr/>
            <p> Securing food for the future is an issue that worries governments and scientists alike. During the twentieth century, the world’s population has quadrupled, and it is estimated that the number will reach ten billion people by 2050. This enormous increase will represent a major challenge and increasing pressure on agricultural production capacity. This has inevitably led to the development of innovative technologies in food manufacturing other than agriculture, including a future technology based on manufacturing food from thin air.

                Agriculture occupies large areas of land, consumes huge amounts of water, and food production through agriculture contributes a large proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions.
                
                Agriculture takes up large areas of land and consumes huge amounts of water. Food production through agriculture also contributes a large proportion of global greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than the total amount of emissions produced by the transportation sector, with all its cars, trucks, planes and trains.</p>
   <h4 class="pb-4 mb-0"> Address</h4>
   <p>Plants get their food through a process called photosynthesis, where plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere into food and release oxygen as a byproduct of this chemical reaction. This process takes place in chloroplasts. Plants use the energy of sunlight to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and other chemical reactions occur that produce glucose, which they use as a food source, and oxygen is released from the plants into the atmosphere. This means that plants convert carbon dioxide into food through complex chemical reactions. Photosynthesis is one of the most important chemical reactions on Earth, and in the past it helped our planet evolve and life appear on it. Plants use carbon dioxide to make their own food, and they release oxygen to help other organisms breathe!</p>
   <h4 class="pb-4 mb-0">Subtitle</h4>
   <p>This process inspired NASA scientists in the 1960s to explore the idea of ​​feeding astronauts on long space missions such as to Mars. One promising idea was to make food from the carbon dioxide produced by astronauts—not by plants but by tiny, single-celled microbes that could harvest the carbon dioxide to produce copious amounts of nutritious protein in the form of a tasteless powder. The material could also be used to make foods we are familiar with.</p>
     <p>Unlike plants, these microbes don’t use light as photosynthesis does for food, so they can grow in the dark. These bacteria are called “hydrogenotrophs,” and they use hydrogen as fuel to make food from carbon dioxide. When astronauts produce carbon dioxide, the microbes capture it and, along with other inputs, convert it into carbon-rich food. In this way, we have a closed-loop carbon cycle.</p>      
     <h4 class="pb-4 mb-0">Subtitle</h4>
     <p>
        More than half a century after NASA’s research, several synthetic biology companies, including Air Protein and Solar Foods, are now developing a new generation of sustainable food products with zero carbon footprints. These food products will not only be available to astronauts but to everyone on Earth, and will be produced in a short period of time, rather than months, and without relying on agricultural land. This means getting food very quickly. Food will also be made vertically using these microbes, rather than the traditional horizontal method similar to modern vertical farming. This means more food will be available from the same. <br>
        
        Human food consists of three main types: <br>

        <ul>
            <li>Proteins</li>
            <li>Carbohydrates</li>
            <li>Fats</li>
          </ul>  </p>
       <p>
        Proteins are made up of amino acids, a group of organic compounds. There are twenty amino acids in the human body, nine of which are essential and obtained from food. Amino acids are mainly made up of: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Carbon</li>
            <li>Hydrogen</li>
            <li>Oxygen</li>
            <li>Nitrogen</li>
          </ul>  </p>
       <p class="mb-5">
        It is noteworthy that nitrogen constitutes 78% of the air, and hydrogen is obtained through the electrolysis of water. It is theoretically possible to extract carbon from the air to form these acids, as carbon is the backbone of amino acids, and life on Earth is based on carbon because of its ability to form long carbon chains, and this is what microbes do by manufacturing amino acids from carbon dioxide through a set of complex chemical reactions. In addition to making protein-rich meals, these microbes produce other products such as oils that have many uses.
        </p>

        <h2 class="pb-1 mb-0  ">Another Post</h2>
        <p class="blog-post-meta   pb-1 mb-4"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">December 23, 2020 by </font><a href="#"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jacob</font></a></p>
<p> Several companies are now studying these microbes more deeply, and cultivating them for food. In 2019, researchers at the American company Air Protein announced that they had succeeded in converting carbon dioxide in the air into artificial meat made of protein, which does not require any agricultural land, but rather relies primarily on air. </p>

   <p> Meat is manufactured in many types. </p>
    
   <p> These researchers used air and renewable energy as inputs in a process similar to fermentation, to produce a protein that contains the nine essential amino acids and is rich in vitamins and minerals, and is free of hormones, antibiotics, pesticides and herbicides.  </p>
    
   <p class="mb-5"> Meat of many types, including poultry, beef and seafood, is produced without carbon emissions, unlike raising cattle, which contributes to the emission of methane, a greenhouse gas</p>

   <h2 class="pb-1 mb-0  ">New Feature</h2>
   <p class="blog-post-meta   pb-1 mb-4"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">December 14, 2020 by </font><a href="#"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Jacob</font></a></p>
<p> 
    Finnish company Solar Foods has developed a technology to produce protein from air. The process begins by splitting water into its components hydrogen and oxygen using electricity. The hydrogen provides energy for bacteria to convert carbon dioxide and nitrogen in the air into protein-rich organic matter more efficiently than plants grow using photosynthesis. The protein resembles wheat flour and has been named “solein.”
    </p>
<p>The company is currently collecting data on the food product to submit to the European Union for food certification, and plans to start commercial production next year, 2021. The company has explained that it is interested in producing environmentally friendly foods by using basic materials: electricity and carbon dioxide, and these foods will avoid the negative environmental impact of traditional agriculture, which includes everything from land and water use to emissions from fertilizing crops or raising animals.</p>
<p> Therefore, proteins derived from microbes will:
    <ul>
        <li>Provides a possible solution to the increasing future global demand for food.</li>
        <li>Food factories of the future will expand to be more efficient and sustainable</li>
        <li>It will be able to provide food for astronauts on their journey to Mars and all the inhabitants of planet Earth in the year 2050 AD</li>
      </ul>
</p>
<p class="mb-5">Imagine that microbes will be the factories of the future, and that the food of the future will be made from air! And that the year 2050 will be completely different from our world today. It will be a world without agriculture or raising animals for food! It may seem fantastic, but it is not impossible!

    You came, and life came with you in all its forms and colors: the plants grow, the trees leaf and blossom, the cat meows, the dove coos, the sheep bleats, the cow moos, and every tame animal calls to its tame one.
